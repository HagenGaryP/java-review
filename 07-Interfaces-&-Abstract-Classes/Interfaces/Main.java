/**
 An interface, in Java terms, specifies which methods of particular class to be implemented, and that class implements the interface.
 The interface you create is abstract, meaning there's no actual code for methods, you only supply the actual method names and the parameters.
 The actual code still goes in the class that you're creating.

 But the idea is to use an interface to provide a common behavior that can be used by several classes by having them all implement the same interface.
 So it's really a way to standardize how a particular set of classes is used.
