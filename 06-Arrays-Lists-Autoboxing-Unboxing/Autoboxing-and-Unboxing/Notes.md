# Autoboxing and Unboxing in Java

**Autoboxing: Converting a primitive value into an object of the corresponding wrapper class is called autoboxing.**
For example, converting int to Integer class. The Java compiler applies autoboxing when a primitive value is:
- Passed as a parameter to a method that expects an object of the corresponding wrapper class.
- Assigned to a variable of the corresponding wrapper class.

**Unboxing: Converting an object of a wrapper type to its corresponding primitive value is called unboxing.**
For example conversion of Integer to int. The Java compiler applies unboxing when an object of a wrapper class is:
- Passed as a parameter to a method that expects a value of the corresponding primitive type.
- Assigned to a variable of the corresponding primitive type.
