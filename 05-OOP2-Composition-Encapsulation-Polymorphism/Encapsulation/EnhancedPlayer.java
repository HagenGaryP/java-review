/**
 * This file shows the proper way of coding (the Player class) with ENCAPSULATION

 * Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables)
   and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
   In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes,
   and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.
   Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

 * To achieve encapsulation in Java âˆ’

    * Declare the variables of a class as private.

    * Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.
